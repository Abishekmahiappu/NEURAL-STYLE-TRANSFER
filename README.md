*DESCRIPTION*: I implemented the Neural Style Transfer project by referring to multiple reliable resources to ensure a clear understanding of both the theory and practical application. I mainly followed the official PyTorch documentation and tutorials, particularly the “Neural Style Transfer” guide, which provided detailed insights into how pre-trained models like VGG19 are used to extract content and style features from images. Additionally, I watched step-by-step YouTube tutorials from channels like Aladdin Persson and freeCodeCamp, which helped me understand how content loss and style loss are calculated using Gram matrices and how the optimization process is carried out using L-BFGS. I also explored GitHub repositories and examples to enhance my coding structure and error handling. For the web interface design, I referred to W3Schools and MDN Web Docs to structure the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components neatly. This hands-on project gave me valuable experience in using deep learning for creative tasks, connecting neural networks with visual outputs, and presenting results in a clean, user-friendly interface. By combining artistic creativity with AI, I was able to build a system that transforms ordinary photos into stylized artworks, showing the real-world application of AI in media and design.
